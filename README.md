### What is Tandem Trivia? 
Tandem Trivia is a quick to play, fun game that was built using the 2020 Tandem Internship code challengeguidelines.  There are A LOT of trivia application tutorials on the internet as it is one of the relatively more basic things someone new to coding can build and have fun with.  For this application I made a firm point to not use any code, any concepts, or even consult any of these walk throughs while building this game.  All of the algorithms for question selection, question scoring, and gameplay were of my own design.  This doesn't mean Tandem Trivia is the best trivia game out there, it means quite the opposite.  The game is not perfect but the game did come from my own mind and I believe shows some of what I am capable of at this point in time.  


### Design
The design of the game was done by hand, the old fashioned way.  While I sometimes use boards like trello, draw.io, or programs like Marvel to organize and prototype applications, with this program I used my personal favorite way, pen and paper.  Below is several images from my design notebook that shows how the game was designed.

### Technologies Used
- React.JS
- Node.JS
- HTML
- CSS (BootStrap)


### Getting Started
To run Tandem Trivia please follow the following steps:
- Clone repository to your computer
- Open in your favorite text editor (I use VS Code or Subliime)
- Install the node modules with 'NPM Install'
- (If necessary) run 'NPM Audit Fix' command
- Start the application with the command 'NPM Start'
- Enjoy! 


### Next Steps
Tandem Trivia is a very imperfect application because of the time crunch it was built under.  With more time I am going to work on completing the following upgrades: 
- Improve Styling
- Get rid of Alert at end of game and push user to a seperate game end page
- Add a timer to the game
- Add power-up features to the game such as 50/50 or Skip a question while still getting a point
